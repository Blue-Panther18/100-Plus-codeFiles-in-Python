cikit-Learn (Chapter 5)
This library provides efficient and clean Python implementations of the most
important and established machine learning algorithms.
The PyData world is certainly much larger than these five packages, and is growing
every day. With this in mind, I make every attempt through these pages to provide
references to other interesting efforts, projects, and packages that are pushing the
boundaries of what can be done in Python. Nevertheless, these five are currently fun‐
damental to much of the work being done in the Python data science space, and I
expect they will remain important even as the ecosystem continues growing around
them.
Using Code Examples
Supplemental material (code examples, figures, etc.) is available for download at
https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook. This book is here to help
you get your job done. In general, if example code is offered with this book, you may
use it in your programs and documentation. You do not need to contact us for per‐
mission unless you’re reproducing a significant portion of the code. For example,
writing a program that uses several chunks of code from this book does not require
permission. Selling or distributing a CD-ROM of examples from O’Reilly books does
require permission. Answering a question by citing this book and quoting example
code does not require permission. Incorporating a significant amount of example
code from this book into your product’s documentation does require permission.
